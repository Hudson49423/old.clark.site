Enjoy one-handed convenience raising and lowering your PT hood with this clever kit!
</B></Big>
<p>
Fits ALL MODEL YEARS (hard top or convertible). Lift your hood just a little, and the pneumatic cylinders take over to gently raise it all the way up. Never again face the annoyance of using the manual factory prop.
<p>
This is also CHEAP INSURANCE against having a well-meaning friend ruin your hood by trying to close it, without realizing the factory prop needed to be moved! (Yes, this does happen!)
<p>
We are the manufacturer of this Kit, and have several hundred happy customers. This is the BEST kit on the market*. Our kit FITS best and LIFTS best. We achieve this by custom fabricating our own brackets to produce optimal mounting and lifting geometry for the gas cylinders as well as a PERFECT fit to your PT.  We DO NOT use off-the-shelf brackets.<br>
<i>*(Other kits have under hood interferences and do a poor job of lifting!). </i>
<li>Sturdy, custom-fabricated and powder-coated steel brackets, and high quality hardware.
<li>Installation is easy, requiring minimal tools and NO DRILLING! 
  <p>An <b>All-Chrome</b> version is available. Includes chromed brackets and 
    hardware for an additional $60 over the end-of-auction price. 
  <p>Either of these kits look best with our Bright Stainless Steel Cylinder Cover 
    Kit ($29.95) available separately. (You can see these in the Chrome Photo, 
    and also the Parts Layout Photo). To see our entire PT Cruiser product line,
